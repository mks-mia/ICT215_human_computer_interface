# HomeBites â€“ Human-Computer Interface Project

**HomeBites** is a cross-platform interface design project that connects passionate home cooks with food enthusiasts looking for authentic, homemade meals. The platform reimagines food discovery through community-building, storytelling, and locally focused interaction.

This was developed as part of an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) group project, focusing on interface design and user experience for web, mobile (Android/iOS), and WatchOS platforms.

## Executive Summary

HomeBites is designed to bridge the gap between consumers craving homemade meals and talented home cooks eager to share their culinary skills. It offers a seamless, multi-platform experience for discovering, ordering, and enjoying local homemade food tailored to individual tastes and dietary needs.

Key features include:
- User registration and personalized profiles  
- Advanced search filters for cuisine, dietary preference, and proximity  
- Communication channels between users  
- A vibrant community forum for feedback, storytelling, and engagement  

## Objective

To design a user-friendly and visually cohesive interface system that enables meaningful interactions and simplifies the process of discovering and ordering homemade meals from local cooks.

## My Role

As the interface lead for **Web and WatchOS**, I contributed:
- User flows and journey mapping
